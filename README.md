# autopilot
# for Ag penta nanorod dimer systems

* autopilot calculates the excitations for Ag penta nanorod dimer systems using TD-DFTB methods. Also, this bash script will remove layer by layer (six Ag atoms for a single layer) in a single nanorod up until half the length of the full nanorod, and create their coordinate files along with the input files.

* this will only handle one charge at a time.

* can also do the same type of calculations for the monomers as well; only need to change the path of the monomer coordinates.

* specified changing locations are highlighted in the script. Other than that feel free to change as needed.
